    "Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "There are various type of data types like int, float,complex,string,list,tuple,set,dict,Boolean.All these can be grouped in different categories.\n",
    " (1).Numeric types - It includes int, float and complex.\n",
    "                  Integers consists of negative or positive whole numbers.Ex: 1,-23,23,etc.\n",
    "                  Floating numbers consists of integers followed by floating points.Ex: 1.0,-23.3,23.03,etc.\n",
    "                  Complex numbers consists of real number+ imaginary part. Ex: 3+4j,3+4j,3-4j,etc.\n",
    "                    \n",
    " (2).Sequence types - It includes list, tuple, string.\n",
    "                  List is just like arrays with ordered and changeable collection of data.It is mutable and allow duplicate values. Ex: l=[1,2,3+4j,\"deep\"]\n",
    "                  Tuple is collection of oredered and unchangeable data. Ex: t = (1,\"qwerty\",2-5j)\n",
    "                  String is the collection of characters stored in the double quote, single quote or triple quote. Ex: \"deepshikha\",'shikha',\"'deep'\"\n",

    "Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "An expression is a combination of operaters(+,-,/,*,>,<,=,!,>=,<=,==,!=) and operands(data and variables) which interprets to give a value.\n",
